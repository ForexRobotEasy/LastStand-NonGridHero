## Grid System Function

```mq5
void OpenGridPositions(double lotSize, double gridDistance, bool openBothSides)
```

This function is used to open grid positions. It takes three parameters:
- `lotSize`: The size of the lot for the positions.
- `gridDistance`: The distance between each grid position.
- `openBothSides`: A boolean value indicating whether to open positions on both sides (buy and sell).

The function first checks if `openBothSides` is `true` or `false`. If it is `true` or `false`, it opens a buy position using the `OrderSend` function with `OP_BUY` type and the current ask price. If `openBothSides` is `true`, it also opens a sell position using the `OrderSend` function with `OP_SELL` type and the current bid price.

## Position Opening Preferences

```mq5
void OpenPositionsOnPreference(double lotSize, bool openBuySide)
```

This function is used to open positions based on a preference. It takes two parameters:
- `lotSize`: The size of the lot for the positions.
- `openBuySide`: A boolean value indicating whether to open a buy position or a sell position.

The function checks if `openBuySide` is `true` or `false`. If it is `true`, it opens a buy position using the `OrderSend` function with `OP_BUY` type and the current ask price. If it is `false`, it opens a sell position using the `OrderSend` function with `OP_SELL` type and the current bid price.

## Minimize Potential Damages

```mq5
void MinimizeDamages()
```

This function is used to implement a damage minimization algorithm. The implementation of the algorithm is not provided in the code and should be added by the user.

## Set Up Instructions

```mq5
void SetUpInstructions()
```

This function is used to provide detailed instructions for setting up the LastStand NonGridHero expert advisor. The implementation of the instructions is not provided in the code and should be added by the user.

## Main Program

```mq5
void OnStart()
```

This is the main program of the expert advisor. It performs the following actions:
1. Set up LastStand NonGridHero by calling the `SetUpInstructions` function.
2. Open grid positions by calling the `OpenGridPositions` function with a lot size of 0.1, a grid distance of 10, and opening positions on both sides.
3. Open positions based on preference by calling the `OpenPositionsOnPreference` function with a lot size of 0.1 and opening a buy position.
4. Minimize potential damages by calling the `MinimizeDamages` function. The implementation of the damage minimization algorithm is not provided in the code and should be added by the user.

Please note that this code is a sample and may not work as intended without proper configuration and implementation of missing parts.
